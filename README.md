As the sample data is provided, the model 'Least Lasso Angle Regressor' will predict the performacne of an individual (Professor) based on some parameters like the number of responses or feedback provided to him/her, which term they taught the class and what course and subject they taught and other variables. Based on the above requirements, the model would be able to predict the performance of an instruictror any where between 75% to 80% accuracy.

The built model is hyperparameter tuned, ensembed to aviod loose fitting .vs over fitting the sample data.
